This project contains a few scripts for testing the tool next tools.  XRay, Codebeamer, TestLab and Practitest.
This require selenium.  I will add other requirements as I figure them out.

4) Install latest version of selenium - sudo pip install 'selenium>=3.9.0'
5) Install latest version of geckodriver (use at least version v0.19.1 or newer) - https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases 
copy the geckodriver file into /usr/bin
